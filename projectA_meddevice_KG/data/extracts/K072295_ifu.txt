Product  Code:  DQA,  CCK
Dated:  September  16,  2007
Received:  September  20,  2007

Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  510(k)  premarket  notification  of intent  to  market  the  device
referenced  above  and have  determined  the  device  is substantially  equivalent  (for the
indications  for use  stated  in  the  enclosure)  to  legally  marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior  to  May  28,  1976,  the  enactment  date of the  Medical  Device
Amendments,  or to  devices  that  have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act (Act)  that do  not require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You  may,  therefore,  market  the  device,  subject  to  the general
controls  provisions  of the  Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act include
requirements  for  annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and  prohibitions  against  misbranding  and  adulteration.

If your device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either  class  II (Special  Controls)  or class  III
(PMA),  it may  be  subject to  such  additional  controls.  Existing  major regulations  affecting
your  device  can  be  found  in  the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21,  Parts  800  to  898.  In
addition,  FDA  may  publish  further  announcements  concerning  your  device  in the Federal
Register.

Page  2  - Ms.  Weissbrod

Please  be  advised  that  FDA's  issuance  of a substantial  equivalence  determination  does  not
mean  that  FDA  has  made  a determination  that  your  device  complies  with  other  requirements
of the  Act  or  any  Federal  statutes  and  regulations  administered  by other  Federal  agencies.
You  must comply  with  all  the  Act's  requirements,  including,  but not  limited  to:  registration
and  listing  (21  CFR  Part  807);  labeling  (21  CFR  Part  801);  good  manufacturing  practice
requirements  as  set forth  in the  quality systems  (QS)  regulation  (21  CFR  Part  820);  and  if
applicable,  the electronic  product  radiation  control  provisions  (Sections  531-542  of the  Act);
21  CFR  1000-1050.

This  letter  will  allow  you  to  begin  marketing  your  device  as  described  in  your Section  510(k)
premarket  notification.  The  FDA finding  of substantial  equivalence  of your  device  to  a
legally  marketed  predicate  device  results  in  a classification  for your  device  and  thus,  permits
your  device  to  proceed  to  the  market.

If you  desire  specific  advice  for  your  device  on our  labeling  regulation  (21  CFR  Part  801),
please  contact  the  Office  of Compliance  at  (240)  276-0115.  Also,  please  note  the regulation
entitled,  "Misbranding  by  reference  to  premarket notification"  (21CFR  Part  807.97).  You
may  obtain  other general  information  on  your  responsibilities  under  the Act  from  the
Division  of Small  Manufacturers,  International  and  Consumer  Assistance  at  its  toll-free
