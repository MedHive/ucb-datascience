is a  single  index  of an  adult  or  pediatric 
patient's  ventilatory  status  displayed  on  a 
scale  of 1 - 10,  where  10  indicates 
optimal  pulmonary  status.  IPI  monitoring
displays  a  single  value that  represents

alerts  clinicians  to changes  in the

patient's  pulmonary  status.

Received:  January  27,  2009

Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  510(k)  premarket  notification  of intent to  market the  device
referenced  above  and  have  determined  the device  is  substantially  equivalent  (for  the
indications  for use  stated  in  the enclosure)  to  legally  marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior to  May  28,  1976,  the  enactment  date  of the Medical  Device
Amendments,  or to  devices  that  have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with the provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug, and  Cosmetic  Act (Act)  that  do not require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You may,  therefore,  market  the device,  subject  tO  the  general
controls  provisions  of the  Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the Act  include
requirements  for annual  registration,  listing of devices,  good  manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and  prohibitions  against misbranding  and  adulteration.

If your device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either  class II (Special  Controls)  or  class  III
(PMA),  it  may be  subject  to  such  additional  controls.  Existing major  regulations  affecting
your device  can  be  found  in the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21,  Parts  800  to  898.  In
addition,  FDA  may  publish  further  announcements  concerning  your device  in  the  Federal
Register.

Please  be  advised  that  FDA's issuance  of a substantial  Equivalence  determination  does  not
mean  that  FDA  has made  a  determination  that  your device  complies  with  other  requirements
of the  Act  or  any Federal  statutes  and  regulations  administered  by  other Federal  agencies.
You must  comply  with  all  the  Act's  requirements,  including,  but not  limited  to:  registration

requirements  as  set  forth  in  the  quality  systems  (QS)  regulation  (2.1  CFR  Part  820);  and  if
applicable,  the  electronic  product  radiation  control  provisions  (Sections  531-542  of the  Act);
21  CFR  1000-1050.

This  letter will allow you  to  begin  marketing  your  device  as described  in  your  Section  510(k)
premarket  notification.  The FDA  finding  of substantial  equivalence  of your  device  to a
legally  marketed  predicate  device  results  in  a classification  for  your device  and thus,  permits
your  device  to  proceed  to the  market.

510(k)  Number  (if known):  K082268

Device  Name:  Capnostream  20

Indications  for Use:
The  Capnostream  20  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  is intended  to  provide
professionally  trained  health  care  providers  the continuous,  non  invasive  measurement  and
monitoring  of  carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the expired  and  inspired  breath  and  respiration
rate,  and  for the  continuous  non-invasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen  saturation  of arterial
hemoglobin  (SpO 2) and  pulse  rate.  It is intended  for use  with  neonatal,  pediatric  and  adult
patients  in hospitals,  hospital  type  facilities,  intra  hospital  transport  and  home  environments.

The  Capnostream  20  monitor  provides  the clinician  with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index  (IPI).
The  IPI  is based  on  four  parameters  provided  by  the  monitor:  end tidal carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IPI  is a  single  index  of an  adult or
pediatric  patient's ventilatory  status displayed  on a  scale  of 1 - 10, where  10  indicates  optimal
pulmonary  status.  IPI  monitoring  displays  a  single  value that  represents  the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts clinicians  to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IPI  is an  adjunct to,  and is  not  intended  to  replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.
