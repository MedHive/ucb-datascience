510(k)  Summary  of  Safety and  Effectiveness

CONCLUSION
Capnostream2O  with  the  micromediCO2  C02  module  does  not  raise any  new  potential
safety risks  and  is equivalent in performance  to  the  existing  legally  marketed  device.
Therefore,  the device  is substantially equivalent to  the  predicate  device with  respect to

Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  5 10(k)  premnarket  notification  of intent to  market  the  device
referenced  above  and  have  determined  the  device  is  substantially  equivalent  (for  the
indications  for  use  stated  in  the  enclosure)  to  legally  marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior  to  May  28,  1976,  the enactment  date  of the Medical  Device
Amendments,  or  to  devices  that  have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug, and  Cosmetic  Act  (Act)  that  do  not  require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You may,  therefore,  market  the  device,  subject to  the general
controls  provisions  of the Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act  include
requirements  for  annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good  manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and  prohibitions  against misbranding  and  adulteration.  Please  note:  CDR-H  does
not  evaluate  information  related  to contract  liability  warranties.  We remind  you,  however,
that  device  labeling  must be  truthful  and  not  misleading.

If your  device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either  class  11  (Special  Controls)  or class  III
(PMA),  it  may  be  subject to  additional  controls.  Existing  major  regulations  affecting  your

Device  Name:  Capnostream  20

Indications  far  Use:
The  Capnostream20  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  is intended to  provide
professionally  trained  health  care  providers  the  continuous,  non  invasive  measurement  and
monitoring  of carbon  dioxide concentration  of the  expired  and  inspired breath  and  respiration
rate,  and  for the  continuous  non-invasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen  saturation  of  arterial
hemoglobin  (SPO 2) and  pulse  rate-  It is intended  for  use with  neonatal,  pediatric  and  adult
patients  in hospitals,  hospital type  facilities, intra  hospital  transport  and  home  environments.
The Capnostreamn20  monitor  provides  the  clinician with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index (IPI).
The  IPI  is based on  four parameters  provided  by the  monitor:  end  tidal  carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IPI  is a single  index of  an  adult  or
pediatric patient's  ventilatory  status displayed  on a scale of  1 - 10,  where  10  indicates  optimal
pulmonary status.  IPI  monitoring  displays a single value  that  represents  the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts  clinicians to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IPI  is an  adjunct to,  and  is not  intended  to  replace,  vital sign  monitoring.
