1.  The  MiniMediCO2 EtCO 2 Module:
Is intended  for  installation  in host devices  that:  are  used  by  physicians,  nurses  and  other
trained  health  care  providers  in critical  care  patient  settings,  such  as anesthesiology,
intensive  care medicine,  neonatal  Intensive  care and  other  health  care areas where  non
invasive  measurement  of expired  C02 and  inspired  C02 are  of  medical  value.  It
continuously  and  non  invasively  measures  and  monitors  carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the
expired  and  inspired  breath  and  respiration  rate.  This  module  is  designed  to  be  installed  in a
host device,  in this case  the two  Parameter  Bedside  Monitor,  that  is for  prescription  use
only.
