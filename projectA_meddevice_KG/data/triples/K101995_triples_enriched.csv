510(k)  Number  (if known):  K1 01 995

Device  Name:  Capnostream20p

Indications for  Use:

The Capnostream@20p  combined  capnograph/pulse oximeter  monitor  and  its  accessories are
intended  to  provide  professionally trained  health  care providers with  continuous,  non-invasive
measurement  and  monitoring  of carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the expired and  inspired  breath
and  respiration  rate,  and  with  continuous  noninvasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen saturation
of arterial  hemoglobin  (SpO2)  and  pulse rate.  It is also indicated  for continuous  non-invasive
monitoring  of carboxyhemoglobin  saturation  (measured  by  an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor),
methemoglobin  saturation  (measured  by an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor)  and  total  hemoglobin
concentration  (measured  by  an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor).  It is intended  for use  with  neonatal,
pediatric,  and  adult patients  in hospitals,  hospital-type facilities,  intra-hospital  transport and
home  environments.

The  Capnostream@020p  monitor provides  the  clinician with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index (IPI).
The  IP1  is based  on  four  parameters  provided  by  the  monitor:  end  tidal carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IP1  is a single index  of an  adult  or
pediatric  patient's  ventilatory status  displayed  on  a scale  of 1 - 10,  where  10  indicates optimal
pulmonary  status.  IP1  monitoring  displays  a single  value that  represents the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts  clinicians to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.
The  IP1  is an  adjunct to,  and  is not  intended to replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.
