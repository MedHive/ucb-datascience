DEVICE  DESCRIPTION

The  Capnostream 20 bedside  monitor  is a  two  parameter  monitor  consisting  of a
miniMediCO 2 capnography  module  and  a pulse  oximetry  module  implemented  in a  host
device.  The  host  device  displays  parameters  received  from  the  respective  modules  and
generates  alarms when  preset  alarm thresholds  are crossed.  The  device  is classified  as
CCK  Class  II according  to 21  CFR  § 868.1400  - Carbon  Dioxide  Analyzer.

This  device  has  two  modules  that are  classified  as follows:

* 

21  CFR  868.1400,  Carbon  Dioxide Analyzer  (Classification  CCK)

*  21  CFR870.2700  Pulse Oximeter  (Classification  DQA)

Each  module  is controlled  by  dedicated  software  that is an  integral  part  of the
respective  module.  Each  module  provides  parameters  to  the host software  (the
Capnostream 20 device  software)  which  then  controls  the  display  of the  received
parameter  values  and  creates  alarms  when the  values  cross the  preset thresholds.
The  miniMediCO 2 capnography  module  software  presented  in this  submission
includes  an  adaptive  averaging  algorithm  defined  as the  A2 Algorithm  for  calculating
the  respiration  rate  from  the  C02 waveform  introduced  in software version  2.31  of  the
miniMediCO 2 capnography  module  software.  The  calculated  respiration  rate
parameter  is then  provided  to the  host  (the  Capnostream 20 device  software).  The  host
makes  no  modification  to  the values  received  from  the module.  The  host triggers  an
alarm  when  the  respiration  rate  high  or  respiration  rate  low thresholds  have  been
crossed.  The  algorithm  employed  in the  respiration  rate  calculation  reduces false
positive  alarms  by filtering  out  noise  and  instantaneous  fluctuations  without  missing
true  alarms that  may  indicate  a clinically  significant  change  to  respiration  rate.  By
