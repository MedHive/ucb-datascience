Dear Mr.  Brown:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  510(k) premarket  notification  of intent to  market the  device
referenced  above and  have  determined  the device  is  substantially  equivalent  (for the
indications  for use  stated  in the enclosure)  to  legally marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior to  May  28,  1976,  the enactment  date  of the  Medical  Device
Amendments,  or to devices  that have  been  reclassified  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and Cosmetic  Act (Act)  that  do  not require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application (PMA).  You may, therefore,  market  the  device,  subject  to  the  general
controls  provisions  of the  Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act  include
requirements  for annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and prohibitions  against  misbranding  and adulteration.

If your device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either class  II (Special  Controls)  or class  III
(PMA),  it may be  subject to such  additional  controls.  Existing  major regulations  affecting
your  device  can  be found  in the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21,  Parts  800  to  898.  In
addition,  FDA may  publish  further announcements  concerning  your  device in the  Federal
Register.
