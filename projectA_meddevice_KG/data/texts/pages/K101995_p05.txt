Traditional  510O(k)  Submission  for CAPNOSTREAM®D20p  with Masimo  MXI  SpO2  Board

(SpO2)  and  pulse  rate.  It is also 
indicated  for continuous  non- 
invasive  monitoring  of 
carboxyhemoglobin  saturation 
(measured  by an 
SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor), 
methemoglobin  saturation 
(measured  by an 
SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor)  and 
total  hemoglobin  concentration 
(measured  by an 
SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor).  It is 
intended  for use with  neonatal, 
pediatric,  and  adult  patients  in 
hospitals,  hospital-type  facilities, 
intra-hospital  transport  and  home 
environments, 

saturation  of arterial
hemoglobin  (SpO2)  and  pulse
rate.  It is intended  for  use  with
neonatal,  pediatric,  and  adult
patients  in hospitals,  hospital-
type  facilities,  intra-hospital
transport  and  home
environments.
The Capnostream®20p
monitor  provides the  clinician
with  an  integrated  pulmonary
index (IPI).  The  IP1  is based
on  four  parameters provided  by
the  monitor:  end  tidal  carbon
dioxide,  respiration  rate,
oxgnstrinadpue
rate.  The  IP1  is a single index

of an  adult  or  pediatric  patients
ventilatory status  displayed  on

indicates optimal  pulmonary
status.  IPI  monitoring  displays
a single value  that represents
the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts
clinicians to  changes  in the
patient's  pulmonary  status.
The  RPI is an  adjunct to,  and  is
not  intended  to  replace, vital
sign  monitoring.

The  Capnostream®D20p  monitor 
provides  the clinician with  anasclof1-0,wee0
integrated  pulmonary  index (IP). 
The  IRI  is based  on  four parameters 
provided  by the  monitor:  end  tidal 
carbon  dioxide,  respiration  rate, 
oxygen  saturation  and  pulse  rate. 
The  RPI is a single  index  of an  adult 
or  pediatric  patient's ventilatory 
status  displayed  on  a scale  of 1 -
10,  where  10  indicates optimal 
pulmonary status.  IPI  monitoring 
displays a single  value that
represents the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts clinicians to
changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary
status.

The IP1  is an adjunct  to,  and  is not
intended  to  replace,  vital  sign
monitoring.
