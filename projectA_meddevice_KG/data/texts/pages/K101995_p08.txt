Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  5 10(k)  premarket  notification  of intent to  market  the  device
referenced  above  and  have  determined  the  device  is  substantially  equivalent  (for  the
indications  for  use  stated  in  the  enclosure)  to  legally marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior  to  May  28,  1976,  the  enactment  date  of the  Medical  Device
Amendments,  or  to  devices  that have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food, Drug,  and  Cosmetic Act  (Act) that  do  not require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You may,  therefore,  market the  device,  subject  to the  general
controls  provisions  of the Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act  include
requirements  for annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and prohibitions  against  misbranding  and  adulteration.  Please  note:  CDR-  does
not evaluate  information  related  to  contract  liability  warranties.  We  remind  you,  however,
that  device  labeling  must be  truthful  and  not misleading.

If your device  is classified  (see  above)  into  either  class  11  (Special  Controls)  or class  ILL
(PMA),  it  may  be subject  to  additional  controls.  Existing  major regulations  affecting  your
device  can  be  found  in  the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title 21,  Parts  800  to 898.  In
addition,  FDA  may  publish  further  announcements  concerning  your device  in the  Federal
Register.
