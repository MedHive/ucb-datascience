Device  Name:  Capnostream  20

Indications  far  Use:
The  Capnostream20  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  is intended to  provide
professionally  trained  health  care  providers  the  continuous,  non  invasive  measurement  and
monitoring  of carbon  dioxide concentration  of the  expired  and  inspired breath  and  respiration
rate,  and  for the  continuous  non-invasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen  saturation  of  arterial
hemoglobin  (SPO 2) and  pulse  rate-  It is intended  for  use with  neonatal,  pediatric  and  adult
patients  in hospitals,  hospital type  facilities, intra  hospital  transport  and  home  environments.
The Capnostreamn20  monitor  provides  the  clinician with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index (IPI).
The  IPI  is based on  four parameters  provided  by the  monitor:  end  tidal  carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IPI  is a single  index of  an  adult  or
pediatric patient's  ventilatory  status displayed  on a scale of  1 - 10,  where  10  indicates  optimal
pulmonary status.  IPI  monitoring  displays a single value  that  represents  the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts  clinicians to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IPI  is an  adjunct to,  and  is not  intended  to  replace,  vital sign  monitoring.
