oxygen  saturation  and  heart  rate.  The  IPI 
is a  single  index  of an  adult  or  pediatric 
patient's  ventilatory  status  displayed  on  a 
scale  of 1 - 10,  where  10  indicates 
optimal  pulmonary  status.  IPI  monitoring
displays  a  single  value that  represents
the  patient's  pulmonary  parameters  and
alerts  clinicians  to changes  in the

patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IPI  is an  adjunct  to,  and  is not
intended  to  replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.
