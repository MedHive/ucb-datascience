Please  be  advised  that  FDA's issuance  of a substantial  Equivalence  determination  does  not
mean  that  FDA  has made  a  determination  that  your device  complies  with  other  requirements
of the  Act  or  any Federal  statutes  and  regulations  administered  by  other Federal  agencies.
You must  comply  with  all  the  Act's  requirements,  including,  but not  limited  to:  registration
and  listing  (21  CFR  Part  807);  labeling  (21  CFR  Part  801);  good manufacturing  practice
requirements  as  set  forth  in  the  quality  systems  (QS)  regulation  (2.1  CFR  Part  820);  and  if
applicable,  the  electronic  product  radiation  control  provisions  (Sections  531-542  of the  Act);
21  CFR  1000-1050.

This  letter will allow you  to  begin  marketing  your  device  as described  in  your  Section  510(k)
premarket  notification.  The FDA  finding  of substantial  equivalence  of your  device  to a
legally  marketed  predicate  device  results  in  a classification  for  your device  and thus,  permits
your  device  to  proceed  to the  market.

If you  desire  specific  advice  for  your device  on  our  labeling  regulation  (21  CFR Part  801),
please  contact  the Center  for  Devices  and  Radiological  Health's  (CDRH's) Office  of
Compliance  at  (240)  276-0120.  Also,  please  note the regulation  entitled,  "Misbranding  by
reference  to  premarket  notification"  (21CFR  Part 807.97).  For  questions  regarding
postmarket  surveillance,  please  contact  CDRH's Office  of Surveillance  and  Biometric's
(OSB's) Division  of Postmarket  Surveillance  at 240-276-3474.  For  questions  regarding  the
reporting  of device  adverse  events  (Medical  Device Reporting  (MDR)),  please  contact the
Division  of Surveillance  Systems  at 240-276-3464.  You may obtain  other  general
information  on your responsibilities  under  the Act from  the  Division  of Small
Manufacturers,  International  and  Consumer  Assistance  at its  toll-free  number  (800)
