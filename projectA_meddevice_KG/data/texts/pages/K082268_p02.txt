DEVICE  DESCRIPTION

The  Capnostream  20  bedside  monitor  is a  two  parameter  monitor consisting  of a
miniMediCO 2 capnography  module  and  a  pulse  oximetry  module  implemented  in a  host
device.  The  host  device  displays  parameters  received  from  the  respective  modules  and
generates  alarms when  preset  alarm  thresholds  are  crossed.  The  device  is classified  as
CCK  Class  I[ according  to  21  CFR  § 868.1400  - Carbon  Dioxide  Analyzer  with  DQA  21
CFR  § 870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  listed  as an  additional  or alternate  classification.

This  device  has  two  modules  that are  classified  as follows:

·

* 

21  CFR  868.1400,  Carbon  Dioxide  Analyzer  (Classification  CCK)

21  CFR  870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  (Classification  DQA)

Each  module  is  controlled  by  dedicated  software  that  is an  integral  part  of the.
respective  module.  Each  module  provides  parameters  to the  host  software  (the
Capnostream  20  device  software)  which  then  controls  the  display  of the  received
parameter  values  and  creates  alarms  when the  values  cross the  preset  thresholds.
The  miniMediCO 2 capnography  module  software  presented  in this  submission
includes  the  ability to  receive  SpO 2 and  pulse  rate  values from  a  pulse  oximetry
module  and  to  calculate  an  integrated  pulmonary  index  (IPI)  which  provides  a
simple  and  clear  single  parameter  representation  of  the  patient's  ventilatory status.
The  IPI,  is  an  integer  value  ranging  from  1-10  based  on  end  tidal  C02,  respiration
rate,  SpO 2 (oxygen  saturation  of arterial  hemoglobin)  and  pulse  rate.  The
calculated  IPI  is then  provided  to  a  host  device  (the Capnostream  20  device  in the
case  of  this submission).  The  host displays  the  index  value  on  the  screen
