DEVICE  DESCRIPTION
The  Capnostream20  bedside monitor is a two parameter  monitor  consisting  of a 002
capnography module  and  a pulse oximetry  module  implemented  in a host  device.  The  host
device displays  parameters  received  from  the  respective  modules  and  generates  alarms
when  preset alarm  thresholds are  crossed.  The  device  is classified as  CCK  Class  IL
according  to 21  CFR  § 868.1400  - Carbon  Dioxide Analyzer  with  DQA 21  CFR  § 870.2700
Pulse  Oximeter  listed  as  an  additional  or alternate  classification.

This device  has two  modules  that  are classified as  follows:

* 

* 

21  CFR  868.1400,  Carbon  Dioxide Analyzer  (Classification  CCK)

21  CFR  870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  (Classification  DQA)

Each  module  is controlled  by dedicated  software that is an  integral  part  of the
respective  module.

INTENDED  USE
The  Capnostream20  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  is intended  to  provide
professionally trained  health  care  providers the continuous,  non  invasive  measurement  and
monitoring  of carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the expired  and  inspired breath  and
respiration  rate,  and  for the  continuous non-invasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen
saturation  of arterial  hemoglobin  (SP0 2)  and  pulse  rate.  It is intended  for  use  with  neonatal,
pediatric and  adult  patients  in hospitals,  hospital type facilities, intra-hospital  transport  and
home  environments.

The  Capnostream20  monitor  provides  the clinician with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index (IPI).
The  IPI  is based  on four parameters  provided  by the  monitor:  end tidal  carbon dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and  pulse rate.  The  IPI  is a single  index of an  adult  or
pediatric  patient's  ventilatory status  displayed on  a scale of 1 - 1 0, where  10  indicates
optimal  pulmonary status.  [Pi  monitoring  displays a single value  that represents  the
