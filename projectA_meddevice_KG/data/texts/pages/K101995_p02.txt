DEVICE  DESCRIPTION
The  Capnostream2op  bedside  monitor  is a two  parameter  monitor consisting  of a

microMediCO2  capnography  module  and/or  a pulse  oximetry  module  implemented  in a

host device.  The  host device  displays parameters  received  from  the  respective  modules

and  generates  alarms when  preset  alarm  thresholds  are  crossed.  The  device  is
classified  as 00K  Class 11  according  to  21  CIFR  § 868.1400  - Carbon  Dioxide Analyzer
with  OQA 21  CFR  § 870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  listed as  an  additional  or  alternate
classification.

This device  has  two  modules  that are  classified  as  follows:

*  21  CFR  868.1400,  Carbon  Dioxide  Analyzer  (Classification  00K)

*  21  CFR  870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  (Classification  OQA).

Each  module  is controlled  by dedicated  software that  is an  integral  part of the
respective  module.  Each  module  provides  parameters  to  the  host software  (the
Capnostream2op  device software)  which then  controls  the  display of the  received
parameter values and  creates  alarms when  the  values cross  the preset  thresholds.

The  microMediCO2  module  provides  the following  inputs to  the  host monitor:

FiCO2,  EtCO2  numeric,  EtCO2  waveform,  Respiratory  Rate,  IPI  (integrated

Pulmonary  Index).
