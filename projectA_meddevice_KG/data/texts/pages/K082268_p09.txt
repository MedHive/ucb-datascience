Device  Name:  Capnostream  20

Indications  for Use:
The  Capnostream  20  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  is intended  to  provide
professionally  trained  health  care  providers  the continuous,  non  invasive  measurement  and
monitoring  of  carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the expired  and  inspired  breath  and  respiration
rate,  and  for the  continuous  non-invasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen  saturation  of arterial
hemoglobin  (SpO 2) and  pulse  rate.  It is intended  for use  with  neonatal,  pediatric  and  adult
patients  in hospitals,  hospital  type  facilities,  intra  hospital  transport  and  home  environments.

The  Capnostream  20  monitor  provides  the clinician  with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index  (IPI).
The  IPI  is based  on  four  parameters  provided  by  the  monitor:  end tidal carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IPI  is a  single  index  of an  adult or
pediatric  patient's ventilatory  status displayed  on a  scale  of 1 - 10, where  10  indicates  optimal
pulmonary  status.  IPI  monitoring  displays  a  single  value that  represents  the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts clinicians  to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IPI  is an  adjunct to,  and is  not  intended  to  replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.
