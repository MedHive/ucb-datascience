Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  5 10(k)  premnarket  notification  of intent to  market  the  device
referenced  above  and  have  determined  the  device  is  substantially  equivalent  (for  the
indications  for  use  stated  in  the  enclosure)  to  legally  marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior  to  May  28,  1976,  the enactment  date  of the Medical  Device
Amendments,  or  to  devices  that  have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug, and  Cosmetic  Act  (Act)  that  do  not  require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You may,  therefore,  market  the  device,  subject to  the general
controls  provisions  of the Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act  include
requirements  for  annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good  manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and  prohibitions  against misbranding  and  adulteration.  Please  note:  CDR-H  does
not  evaluate  information  related  to contract  liability  warranties.  We remind  you,  however,
that  device  labeling  must be  truthful  and  not  misleading.

If your  device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either  class  11  (Special  Controls)  or class  III
(PMA),  it  may  be  subject to  additional  controls.  Existing  major  regulations  affecting  your
device  can  be  found  in the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21,  Parts  800  to  898.  In
addition,  FDA  may  publish  further  announcements  concerning  your device  in  the  Federal
Register.
