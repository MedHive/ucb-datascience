Dear  Ms.  Weissbrod:

We  have  reviewed  your  Section  510(k)  premarket  notification  of intent  to  market  the  device
referenced  above  and have  determined  the  device  is substantially  equivalent  (for the
indications  for use  stated  in  the  enclosure)  to  legally  marketed  predicate  devices  marketed  in
interstate  commerce  prior  to  May  28,  1976,  the  enactment  date of the  Medical  Device
Amendments,  or to  devices  that  have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
the  Federal  Food,  Drug,  and  Cosmetic  Act (Act)  that do  not require  approval  of a premarket
approval  application  (PMA).  You  may,  therefore,  market  the  device,  subject  to  the general
controls  provisions  of the  Act.  The  general  controls  provisions  of the  Act include
requirements  for  annual  registration,  listing  of devices,  good manufacturing  practice,
labeling,  and  prohibitions  against  misbranding  and  adulteration.

If your device  is  classified  (see  above)  into  either  class  II (Special  Controls)  or class  III
(PMA),  it may  be  subject to  such  additional  controls.  Existing  major regulations  affecting
your  device  can  be  found  in  the  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21,  Parts  800  to  898.  In
addition,  FDA  may  publish  further  announcements  concerning  your  device  in the Federal
Register.
