DEVICE  DESCRIPTION
The  Capnostream2op  bedside  monitor  is a two  parameter  monitor consisting  of a

microMediCO2  capnography  module  and/or  a pulse  oximetry  module  implemented  in a

host device.  The  host device  displays parameters  received  from  the  respective  modules

and  generates  alarms when  preset  alarm  thresholds  are  crossed.  The  device  is
classified  as 00K  Class 11  according  to  21  CIFR  § 868.1400  - Carbon  Dioxide Analyzer
with  OQA 21  CFR  § 870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  listed as  an  additional  or  alternate
classification.

This device  has  two  modules  that are  classified  as  follows:

*  21  CFR  868.1400,  Carbon  Dioxide  Analyzer  (Classification  00K)

*  21  CFR  870.2700  Pulse  Oximeter  (Classification  OQA).

Each  module  is controlled  by dedicated  software that  is an  integral  part of the
respective  module.  Each  module  provides  parameters  to  the  host software  (the
Capnostream2op  device software)  which then  controls  the  display of the  received
parameter values and  creates  alarms when  the  values cross  the preset  thresholds.

The  microMediCO2  module  provides  the following  inputs to  the  host monitor:

FiCO2,  EtCO2  numeric,  EtCO2  waveform,  Respiratory  Rate,  IPI  (integrated

Pulmonary  Index).

Traditional  510O(k)  Submission  for CAPNOSTREAM®20p  with Masimo  MXI  Sp02  Board
The  Masimo  MVX1  SpO2  module,  integrated  in the  Capnostream2O  p monitor  presented

in this  submission,  provides  the following  parameters  to  the  host for display:  SpO2

(functional  oxygen saturation  of arterial  hemoglobin),  pulse rate,  SpCO

(carboxyhemoglobin  saturation  in blood),  SpMet  (methemoglobin  saturation  in blood)

and  SpHb  (total  hemoglobin  concentration  in blood).

The host  monitor will display this data  to  the  user in numerics  via  a screen,  and  will

also  display the  002 waveform  and  SP02  (pleth)  waveform  or  pulse bar  graph.

The three  measurements  will  be  available  both  real time  and  in trend  summaries.

In addition,  the  MVX1  board  provides  a Perfusion  Index  (Pl)  indicating  the  relative

pulsatile  strength  at  the  sampling  site  is provided  to  the  host monitor for display.

The  host displays the  Rainbow  SET  parameters  values on  the  screen  alongside  the

four  IP1  (Integrated  Pulmonary  Index)  parameters  and  the  IPI  value  as  presented  on

the  predicate  device.

INTENDED  USE

The  Capnostream®20p  combined  capnograph/pulse  oximeter  monitor  and  its
accessories are  intended  to  provide  professionally trained  health  care  providers  with

continuous,  non-invasive  measurement  and  monitoring  of carbon  dioxide  concentration
of the  expired and  inspired  breath  and  respiration  rate,  and  with  continuous  noninvasive
monitoring  of functional  oxygen  saturation  of arterial  hemoglobin  (SpO2)  and  pulse  rate.
It is also indicated  for continuous  non-invasive monitoring  of carboxyhemoglobin

saturation  (measured  by  an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor),  methemoglobin  saturation
(measured  by an  SpCOfSpMetISpHb  sensor)  and  total  hemoglobin  concentration

(measured  by an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor).  It is intended  for  use  with  neonatal,
pediatric,  and  adult  patients  in hospitals,  hospital-type facilities,  intra-hospital  transport

and  home  environments.

The  Capnostream@20p  monitor provides  the clinician  with  an  integrated  pulmonary
index  (IPI).  The  IP1  is based  on  four parameters  provided  by the monitor:  end  tidal
carbon  dioxide,  respiration  rate,  oxygen  saturation  and. pulse  rate.  The  IP1  is a single
index  of an  adult or  pediatric  patient's  ventilatory  status  displayed  on  a scale  of  1 - 10,

Traditional  510(k)  Submission  for  CAPNOSTREAM020p  with Masimo  MX1  SpO2  Board
where  10  indicates  optimal  pulmonary  status.  IP1  monitoring  displays a single  value that
represents  the  patient's  pulmonary  parameters  and  alerts  clinicians to  changes  in the

patient's  pulmonary  status.

The  IP1  is an  adjunct to,  and  is not  intended to  replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.

COMPARISON  TO  PREDICATE  DEVICES
The  Capnostream20p  with  Masimo  MX1  board  is equivalent  to  the  predicate

Capnostream2O  with  microMediCO2  002 board  with  the exception  of the  addition  of the

three  Rainbow SET  parameters  (SpCO,  SpMET  and  Spl-b).

The  new  device meets  the  safety  and  performance  standards  met  by the  predicate

devices.

Software  testing  was  performed  to validate the  performance  of the  new  monitor

software  and  its  substantial equivalence  to  the  predicate  device. The  functional  features

and  the  intended  use  of Capnostream2op  with  Masimo  MX1  board  are  substantially

equivalent to  the  predicate  devices.

A  hazard  analysis was  carried  out on  the  Capnostream  host  monitor displaying the

Rainbow  SET  values. This  hazard  analysis  concluded  that any residual  risks were

judged  as  acceptable when  weighed  against  the  intended  benefits  of use of the  system.

Device  Name:  Capnostream20p

Indications for  Use:

The Capnostream@20p  combined  capnograph/pulse oximeter  monitor  and  its  accessories are
intended  to  provide  professionally trained  health  care providers with  continuous,  non-invasive
measurement  and  monitoring  of carbon  dioxide  concentration  of the expired and  inspired  breath
and  respiration  rate,  and  with  continuous  noninvasive  monitoring  of functional  oxygen saturation
of arterial  hemoglobin  (SpO2)  and  pulse rate.  It is also indicated  for continuous  non-invasive
monitoring  of carboxyhemoglobin  saturation  (measured  by  an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor),
methemoglobin  saturation  (measured  by an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor)  and  total  hemoglobin
concentration  (measured  by  an  SpCO/SpMetISpHb  sensor).  It is intended  for use  with  neonatal,
pediatric,  and  adult patients  in hospitals,  hospital-type facilities,  intra-hospital  transport and
home  environments.

The  Capnostream@020p  monitor provides  the  clinician with  an  integrated  pulmonary  index (IPI).
The  IP1  is based  on  four  parameters  provided  by  the  monitor:  end  tidal carbon  dioxide,
respiration  rate,  oxygen saturation  and  pulse  rate.  The  IP1  is a single index  of an  adult  or
pediatric  patient's  ventilatory status  displayed  on  a scale  of 1 - 10,  where  10  indicates optimal
pulmonary  status.  IP1  monitoring  displays  a single  value that  represents the  patient's  pulmonary
parameters  and  alerts  clinicians to  changes  in the  patient's  pulmonary  status.
The  IP1  is an  adjunct to,  and  is not  intended to replace,  vital  sign  monitoring.
