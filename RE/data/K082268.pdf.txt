DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Capnostream 20 bedside monitor is a two parameter monitor consisting of a
miniMediCO 2capnography module and a pulse oximetry module implemented in a host
device. The host device displays parameters received from the respective modules and
generates alarms when preset alarm thresholds are crossed. The device is classified as
CCK Class I[ according to 21 CFR § 868.1400 -Carbon Dioxide Analyzer with DQA 21
CFR § 870.2700 Pulse Oximeter listed as an additional or alternate classification.
This device has two modules that are classified as follows:
·21 CFR 868.1400, Carbon Dioxide Analyzer (Classification CCK)
* 21 CFR 870.2700 Pulse Oximeter (Classification DQA)
Each module is controlled by dedicated software that is an integral part of the.
respective module. Each module provides parameters to the host software (the
Capnostream 20 device software) which then controls the display of the received
parameter values and creates alarms when the values cross the preset thresholds.
The miniMediCO 2capnography module software presented in this submission
includes the ability to receive SpO2and pulse rate values from a pulse oximetry
module and to calculate an integrated pulmonary index (IPI) which provides a
simple and clear single parameter representation of the patient's ventilatory status.
The IPI, is an integer value ranging from 1-10 based on end tidal C02, respiration
rate, SpO2(oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin) and pulse rate. The
calculated IPI is then provided to a host device (the Capnostream 20 device in the
case of this submission). The host displays the index value on the screenalongside the four parameters presented on the predicate device. The IPI feature
is not intended for use in the monitoring of children aged less than one year or
neonates and the feature is disabled when neonatal mode is selected by the user.
However, the monitor itself may continue to be used, in a manner that is identical
to the predicate device in all respects, for all patient populations.
The MiniMediCO2 module software is designed to enable the index to be calculated by
accepting SpO2 and heart rate values supplied at the required rate (once a second) by
any type of pulse oximetry module implemented in a host device. The miniMediCO2
module with IPI software may be implemented in any other pulse oximetry enabled host
monitor after making the required changes to the host software to allow provision of
SpO2 and pulse rate values to the module and display of the IPI by the host. The host
will continue to display the four reference parameters and any other parameters
provided by the monitor with the IPI as an addition.
INTENDED USE
The Capnostream 20 combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor is intended to
provide professionally trained health care providers the continuous, non invasive
measurement and monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration of the expired and
inspired breath and respiration rate, and for the continuous non-invasive monitoring of
functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate. It is intended
for use with neonatal, pediatric and adult patients in hospitals, hospital type facilities,
intra-hospital transport and home environments.
The Capnostream 20 monitor provides the clinician with an integrated pulmonary index
(IPI). The IPI is based on four parameters provided by the monitor: end tidal carbon
dioxide, respiration rate, oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The IPI is a single index of
an adult or pediatric patient's ventilatory status displayed on a scale of 1 -10, where 10
indicates optimal pulmonary status. IPI monitoring displays a single value that
represents the patient's pulmonary parameters and alerts clinicians to changes in the
patient's pulmonary status.
The IPI is an adjunct to, and is not intended to replace, vital sign monitoring.COMPARISON TO PREDICATE DEVICE
The Capnostream 20 with IPI is equivalent to the predicate Capnostream 20
(miniMediCO2 software version 2.31) with the exception of the software changes to the
miniMediCO2 capnography module and the changes to the Capnostream 20 host
software.
The new device meets the safety and performance standards met by the predicate
device.
Software testing was performed to validate the performance of the new software and its
substantial equivalence to the predicate device. A clinical evaluation was performed to
ensure that the modified device meets user requirements. A safety and effectiveness
evaluation was performed to demonstrate that the IPI identified all instances in which
clinical intervention was required and alerted the practitioner to these changes. The
functional features and the intended use of Capnostream 20 with IPI are substantially
equivalent to the predicate device.
A hazard analysis was carried out on the module with the IPI functionality and on the
Capnostream 20 host monitor displaying the IPI values. This hazard analysis concluded
that any residual risks were judged as acceptable when weighed against the intended
benefits of use of the system.

Dear Ms. Weissbrod:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in
interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket
approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject tO the general
controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting
your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal
Register.Page 2 -Ms. Weissbrod
Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial Equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements
of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration
and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice

applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act);
21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a
legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits
your device to proceed to the market.
