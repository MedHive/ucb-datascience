DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Capnostream2op bedside monitor is a two parameter monitor consisting of a
microMediCO2 capnography module and/or a pulse oximetry module implemented in a
host device. The host device displays parameters received from the respective modules
and generates alarms when preset alarm thresholds are crossed. The device is
classified as 00K Class 11 according to 21 CIFR § 868.1400 -Carbon Dioxide Analyzer
with OQA 21 CFR § 870.2700 Pulse Oximeter listed as an additional or alternate
classification.
This device has two modules that are classified as follows:
* 21 CFR 868.1400, Carbon Dioxide Analyzer (Classification 00K)
* 21 CFR 870.2700 Pulse Oximeter (Classification OQA).
Each module is controlled by dedicated software that is an integral part of the
respective module. Each module provides parameters to the host software (the
Capnostream2op device software) which then controls the display of the received
parameter values and creates alarms when the values cross the preset thresholds.
The microMediCO2 module provides the following inputs to the host monitor:
FiCO2, EtCO2 numeric, EtCO2 waveform, Respiratory Rate, IPI (integrated
Pulmonary Index).

Traditional 510O(k) Submission for CAPNOSTREAM®20p with Masimo MXI Sp02 Board
The Masimo MVX1 SpO2 module, integrated in the Capnostream2O p monitor presented
in this submission, provides the following parameters to the host for display: SpO2
(functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin), pulse rate, SpCO
(carboxyhemoglobin saturation in blood), SpMet (methemoglobin saturation in blood)
and SpHb (total hemoglobin concentration in blood).
The host monitor will display this data to the user in numerics via a screen, and will
also display the 002 waveform and SP02 (pleth) waveform or pulse bar graph.
The three measurements will be available both real time and in trend summaries.
In addition, the MVX1 board provides a Perfusion Index (Pl) indicating the relative
pulsatile strength at the sampling site is provided to the host monitor for display.
The host displays the Rainbow SET parameters values on the screen alongside the
four IP1 (Integrated Pulmonary Index) parameters and the IPI value as presented on
the predicate device.
INTENDED USE
The Capnostream®20p combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor and its
accessories are intended to provide professionally trained health care providers with
continuous, non-invasive measurement and monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration
of the expired and inspired breath and respiration rate, and with continuous noninvasive
monitoring of functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate.
It is also indicated for continuous non-invasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin
saturation (measured by an SpCO/SpMetISpHb sensor), methemoglobin saturation
(measured by an SpCOfSpMetISpHb sensor) and total hemoglobin concentration
(measured by an SpCO/SpMetISpHb sensor). It is intended for use with neonatal,
pediatric, and adult patients in hospitals, hospital-type facilities, intra-hospital transport
and home environments.
The Capnostream@20p monitor provides the clinician with an integrated pulmonary
index (IPI). The IP1 is based on four parameters provided by the monitor: end tidal
carbon dioxide, respiration rate, oxygen saturation and. pulse rate. The IP1 is a single
index of an adult or pediatric patient's ventilatory status displayed on a scale of 1 -10,
Oridion Medical 1 987 Ltd. 4

where 10 indicates optimal pulmonary status. IP1 monitoring displays a single value that
represents the patient's pulmonary parameters and alerts clinicians to changes in the
patient's pulmonary status.
The IP1 is an adjunct to, and is not intended to replace, vital sign monitoring.
COMPARISON TO PREDICATE DEVICES
The Capnostream20p with Masimo MX1 board is equivalent to the predicate
Capnostream2O with microMediCO2 002 board with the exception of the addition of the
three Rainbow SET parameters (SpCO, SpMET and Spl-b).
The new device meets the safety and performance standards met by the predicate
devices.
Software testing was performed to validate the performance of the new monitor
software and its substantial equivalence to the predicate device. The functional features
and the intended use of Capnostream2op with Masimo MX1 board are substantially
equivalent to the predicate devices.
A hazard analysis was carried out on the Capnostream host monitor displaying the
Rainbow SET values. This hazard analysis concluded that any residual risks were
judged as acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits of use of the system.

Indications for Use
November 24, 2010
510(k) Number (if known): K1 01 995
Device Name: Capnostream20p
Indications for Use:
The Capnostream@20p combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor and its accessories are
intended to provide professionally trained health care providers with continuous, non-invasive
measurement and monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration of the expired and inspired breath
and respiration rate, and with continuous noninvasive monitoring of functional oxygen saturation
of arterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate. It is also indicated for continuous non-invasive
monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin saturation (measured by an SpCO/SpMetISpHb sensor),
methemoglobin saturation (measured by an SpCO/SpMetISpHb sensor) and total hemoglobin
concentration (measured by an SpCO/SpMetISpHb sensor). It is intended for use with neonatal,
pediatric, and adult patients in hospitals, hospital-type facilities, intra-hospital transport and
home environments.
The Capnostream@020p monitor provides the clinician with an integrated pulmonary index (IPI).
The IP1 is based on four parameters provided by the monitor: end tidal carbon dioxide,
respiration rate, oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The IP1 is a single index of an adult or
pediatric patient's ventilatory status displayed on a scale of 1 -10, where 10 indicates optimal
pulmonary status. IP1 monitoring displays a single value that represents the patient's pulmonary
parameters and alerts clinicians to changes in the patient's pulmonary status.
The IP1 is an adjunct to, and is not intended to replace, vital sign monitoring.
