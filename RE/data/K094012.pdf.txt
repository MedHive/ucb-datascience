following commercially available device:

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Capnostream20 bedside monitor is a two parameter monitor consisting of a 002
capnography module and a pulse oximetry module implemented in a host device. The host
device displays parameters received from the respective modules and generates alarms
when preset alarm thresholds are crossed. The device is classified as CCK Class IL
according to 21 CFR § 868.1400 -Carbon Dioxide Analyzer with DQA 21 CFR § 870.2700
Pulse Oximeter listed as an additional or alternate classification.
This device has two modules that are classified as follows:
* 21 CFR 868.1400, Carbon Dioxide Analyzer (Classification CCK)
* 21 CFR 870.2700 Pulse Oximeter (Classification DQA)
Each module is controlled by dedicated software that is an integral part of the
respective module.
INTENDED USE
The Capnostream20 combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor is intended to provide
professionally trained health care providers the continuous, non invasive measurement and
monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration of the expired and inspired breath and
respiration rate, and for the continuous non-invasive monitoring of functional oxygen
saturation of arterial hemoglobin (SP02) and pulse rate. It is intended for use with neonatal,
pediatric and adult patients in hospitals, hospital type facilities, intra-hospital transport and
home environments.
The Capnostream20 monitor provides the clinician with an integrated pulmonary index (IPI).
The IPI is based on four parameters provided by the monitor: end tidal carbon dioxide,
respiration rate, oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The IPI is a single index of an adult or
pediatric patient's ventilatory status displayed on a scale of 1 -1 0, where 10 indicates
optimal pulmonary status. [Pi monitoring displays a single value that represents the
Page I11SPECIAL-51O(k) Submission for CAPNOSTREAM20 two parameter bedside monitor with microMediC02 002 module
510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
patient's pulmonary parameters and alerts clinicians to changes in the patient's pulmonary
status.
The IPI is an adjunct to, and is not intended to replace, vital sign monitoring
COMPARISON TO PREDICATE DEVICE
The Capnostream2O with the micromediCO2 C02 module is substantially equivalent to the
predicate Capnostream2O with the minimedi0O2 C02 module.
The new device meets the safety and performance standards met by the predicate device.
The functional features and the intended use of the Capnostream2O with the new C02
module are substantially equivalent to the predicate device. No significant changes were
made to the monitor hardware or software specifications to support the integration of the
new module. Slight mechanical changes were made to the monitor to accommodate the
smaller dimensions of the new module. The micromediCO2 module is smaller in size than
the miniMediC02 module, in order to facilitate integration inside other OEM monitors, and
provides enhanced processing and memory capacity, to support software applications for
future development. The module provides the following inputs to the host monitor:
FiCO2, EtCO2 numeric, EtCO2 waveform, Respiratory Rate, IPI (integrated Pulmonary
Index), and continuous 002 numeric and waveform.
The micromediCO2 includes a smaller lamp, a new solenoid, broader use of molded parts
to improve production quality, increased processing power, reduced power consumption
and improved flow regulation.
The module software provides full backward compatibility with the miniMedic02 and
supports RS232 or USB communication with the host monitor.
A hazard analysis was carried out on the module and on the Capnostream2O monitor with
the new module. This hazard analysis concluded that any residual risks were judged as
acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits of use of the system. Verification
and validation of the new module as a standalone and when integrated in the monitor were
successfully completed.

510(k) Summary of Safety and Effectiveness
CONCLUSION
Capnostream2O with the micromediCO2 C02 module does not raise any new potential
safety risks and is equivalent in performance to the existing legally marketed device.
Therefore, the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device with respect to
safety, effectiveness, and intended use.
