DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Capnostream 20bedside monitor is a two parameter monitor consisting of a
miniMediCO 2capnography module and a pulse oximetry module implemented in a host
device. The host device displays parameters received from the respective modules and
generates alarms when preset alarm thresholds are crossed. The device is classified as
CCK Class II according to 21 CFR § 868.1400 -Carbon Dioxide Analyzer.
This device has two modules that are classified as follows:
* 21 CFR 868.1400, Carbon Dioxide Analyzer (Classification CCK)
* 21 CFR870.2700 Pulse Oximeter (Classification DQA)
Each module is controlled by dedicated software that is an integral part of the
respective module. Each module provides parameters to the host software (the
Capnostream 20device software) which then controls the display of the received
parameter values and creates alarms when the values cross the preset thresholds.
The miniMediCO 2capnography module software presented in this submission
includes an adaptive averaging algorithm defined as the A2Algorithm for calculating
the respiration rate from the C02 waveform introduced in software version 2.31 of the
miniMediCO 2capnography module software. The calculated respiration rate
parameter is then provided to the host (the Capnostream 20device software). The host
makes no modification to the values received from the module. The host triggers an
alarm when the respiration rate high or respiration rate low thresholds have been
crossed. The algorithm employed in the respiration rate calculation reduces false
positive alarms by filtering out noise and instantaneous fluctuations without missing
true alarms that may indicate a clinically significant change to respiration rate. By
Oridion Medical 1987 Ltd. 13SPECIAL-CAPNOSTREAM20-Two Parameter Monitor With A2 Software CONFIDENTIAL
employing the adaptive averaging algorithm, the respiration rate accurately reflects the
patient's condition and significantly reduces the generation of nuisance alarms by the
host.
INTENDED USE
The Capnostream 20combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor is intended to provide
professionally trained health care providers the continuous, non invasive measurement and
monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration of the expired and inspired breath and
respiration rate, and for the continuous non-invasive monitoring of functional oxygen
saturation of arterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate. It is intended for use with neonatal,
pediatric and adult patients in hospitals, hospital type facilities, intra hospital transport and
home environments.
COMPARISON TO PREDICATE DEVICE
The Capnostream 20 with adaptive averaging (A2) software (miniMediCO2 software version
2.31) is identical to the predicate Capnostream 2o (miniMediCO2 software version 2.20) with
the exception of the algorithm changes. No changes to the host (Capnostream 2o) software
were made to support the new module algorithms and no significant hardware changes
have been made to the device.
The new device meets the safety and performance standards met by the predicate device.
Test data are provided to validate the performance of the software and its substantial
equivalence to the predicate device. The functional features and the intended use of
Capnostream 20with adaptive averaging software are substantially equivalent to the
predicate device.
A hazard analysis was carried out on the module with the new algorithms. This hazard
analysis concluded that any residual risks were judged as acceptable when weighed
against the intended benefits of use of the system.

Dear Ms. Weissbrod:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in
interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket
approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting
your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal
Register.Page 2 -Ms. Weissbrod
Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements
of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration
and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice

applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act);
21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a
legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits
your device to proceed to the market.
