This device has two modules that are classified as follows:
* 21 CFR 868.1400, carbon dioxide analyzer
* 21 CFR870.2700 Pulse Oximeter
INTENDED USE
The Capnostream20 is intended for CO2and SP02 indications. The Capnostream 20
combined capnograph/pulse oximeter monitor is intended to provide professionally trained
health care providers the continuous, non invasive measurement and monitoring of carbon
dioxide concentration of the expired and inspired breath and respiration rate, and for the
continuous non-invasive monitoring of functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin
(SpO2and pulse rate). It is intended for use with neonatal, pediatric and adult patients in
hospitals, hospital type facilities, intra hospital moves and home environments.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The Capnostream 20Bedside Monitor is comprised of two modules used in previously FDA
cleared devices with the following indications for use, which together are the indications for
use for the two parameter bedside monitor:
Capnostream 20
1. The MiniMediCO 2EtCO2Module:
Is intended for installation in host devices that: are used by physicians, nurses and other
trained health care providers in critical care patient settings, such as anesthesiology,
intensive care medicine, neonatal Intensive care and other health care areas where noninvasive measurement of expired C02 and inspired C02 are of medical value. It
continuously and non invasively measures and monitors carbon dioxide concentration of the
expired and inspired breath and respiration rate. This module is designed to be installed in ahost device, in this case the two Parameter Bedside Monitor, that is for prescription use
only.
2. The MP100 Oximetry Module
Is indicated for the continuous non-invasive monitoring of functional oxygen saturation ofarterial hemoglobin (SpO2) and pulse rate. It is intended for use with neonatal, pediatric,
and adult patients during both no motion and motion conditions and for patients who are
either well or poorly perfused. It is to be used by physicians, nurses and other trained health
care providers in critical care patient settings, such as anesthesiology, intensive care
medicine, neonatal Intensive care and other health care areas. This module is designed to
be installed in a host device, in this case the two Parameter Bedside Monitor, that is for
prescription use only..

Dear Mr. Brown:
We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device
referenced above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the
indications for use stated in the enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in
interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device
Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a premarket
approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. The general controls provisions of the Act include
requirements for annual registration, listing of devices, good manufacturing practice,
labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration.
If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III
(PMA), it may be subject to such additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting
your device can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In
addition, FDA may publish further announcements concerning your device in the Federal
Register.Page 2 -Mr. Brown
Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not
mean that FDA has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements
of the Act or any Federal statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies.
You must comply with all the Act's requirements, including, but not limited to: registration
and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part 801); good manufacturing practice
requirements as set forth in the quality systems (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820); and if
applicable, the electronic product radiation control provisions (Sections 531-542 of the Act);
21 CFR 1000-1050.
This letter will allow you to begin marketing your device as described in your Section 510(k)
premarket notification. The FDA finding of substantial equivalence of your device to a
legally marketed predicate device results in a classification for your device and thus, permits
your device to proceed to the market.
If you desire specific advice for your device on our labeling regulation (21 CFR Part 801),
please contact the Office of Compliance at (240) 276-0120. Also, please note the regulation
entitled, "Misbranding by reference to premarket notification" (21 CFR Part 807.97). You
may obtain other general information on your responsibilities under the Act from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance at its toll-free
number (800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597 or at its Internet address
